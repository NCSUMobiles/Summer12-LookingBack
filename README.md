## Elevator Pitch
Retrospective gives you a window to the past. Match the photographer’s position and see exactly what the camera captured years ago. Overlay the original picture with the current view to explore the past in a unique way. Share time travel through photography on Facebook and Twitter.

## Future

*	Web server for serving new pictures
*	Facelift
*	Smooth overlay movement
*	Crowd-source positioning: On user demand, disabled Location/Heading movement and allow user to center picture manually. Capture user location, heading to improve data.
*	Capture both photographer's position and object's position for each picture.
*	Implement Twitter sharing and polish Facebook integration.

## Difficulties
*	Unable to record screen (video shows a mockup instead)
	*	Simulator doesn't have: camera, compass
	*	Outdoor screen was impossible to record
*	Running the app on a device requires an Apple Developer account

### Scenario / User Story

Raleigh has grown so fast and all the pictures of its history, stored in multiple archives, are hard to connect with the current reality.

John is a history student at NC State. A Raleigh local, John is passionate about the history of Raleigh and its change across the years. John’s friend, Laura is from out of state and knows the modern city we all see now. Walking in Downtown Raleigh, John is explaining Laura the growth the Downtown has had the last years. He pulls his iPad out and points to the Plaza Condominiums building. A picture from the building’s construction is available and shown overlayed of the current view of the building. Both walk closer to match the photographer's position and take a better look of how the construction site looked back in the day.

_RETROSPECTIVE_ THIS is a unique way of exploring our city’s past.
